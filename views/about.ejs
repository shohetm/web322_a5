                    <p class="mt-4">My name is Mike. I am working towards finishing my third semester in Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca Polytechnic. Aside from programming, my hobbies include a variety of physical activities, including Brazilian Jiujitsu, which I have been training for nearly 20 years and received my brown belt last year. Along with Jiujitsu, I also enjoy hockey, as any good Canadian boy would, as well as hiking and being outdoors.</p>
